            <h4>Steps in preparing Jollof rice</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper,
                    scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor <br>
                    or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure
                    that everything is blended well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat.
                    Once the oil is <br> heated add the onions you set aside and fry
                    just until they turn golden brown. <br> Once the onions, have
                    turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for <br> 2-3
                    minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture
                    (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) <br> and fry the
                    mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. <br>
                    Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. <br>
                    Mix and add your seasonings <br> (salt, curry
                    powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). <br>
                    Continue to boil for 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. <br>
                    At this point if you need to add water so that
                    the rice is level with the tomato <br> mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so.
                    Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, <br> and cook
                    on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, <br>
                    and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat
                    until the liquid has completely dried up. <br> Turn off the heat,
                    mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!
